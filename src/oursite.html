<h2>Come Check out the Lake</h2><br>

<p>
Swerve Watersports Center is on Lake Grace in Hillsboro Tennessee. It is a custom built water ski lake dug in 2004 by Nicky Lowe.  Surrounded on one side by woods, grass trail and marsh, the other by some nice houses, the sight is beautiful.   The lake was designed specifically for 3-event water skiing with a shallow depth, slopes to eliminate rollers, and the perfect shape. Located in Hillsboro TN, it is close to civilization but far out enough to feel like the country.  Only 2 minutes from I-24 which runs directly between Nashville and Chattanooga, there is never a shortage of entertainment or sightseeing within an hour's drive.  With restaurants and big name stores less than 5 minutes away, anything you might need is also close at hand.  <br>  
At our site you should expect to find a relaxed and friendly environment with great skiers and coaches.  Come ski with us!
