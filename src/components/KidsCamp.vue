<p style="margin-top: 2.5vh; margin-bottom: 7vh;">&#8195; &#8195;At Swerve, our staff is passionate about introducing kids to the excitement of watersports in a fun, safe, and supportive environment. Our Kids Camp is designed for children of all ages and skill levels - whether they’ve never set foot on the water or are seasoned athletes looking to learn their next skill or take their skiing to the next level. 

We aim to create a positive, welcoming space where kids can learn new skills, develop social connections, and build confidence on and off the water. Through waterskiing, wakeboarding, kneeboarding, and more, campers will discover the joy of watersports while making lasting memories and friendships. We believe every child should have the chance to experience the thrill of the water and grow as both athletes and individuals.
